# Contributing

This document provides guidelines on contributing to this repository. Please
follow these guidelines when creating issues, making commits, and submitting
pull requests. The repository maintainers review all pull requests and verify
that they conform to these guidelines before approving and merging.

Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your
interactions with the project.

## Contribution Ideas

1. Raise issues for bugs, features, and enhancements.
2. Submit updates and improvements to the documentation.
3. Submit articles and guides, which are also part of the documentation.
4. Help out repo maintainers by answering questions.
5. Share feedback and let us know about interesting use cases.

## What should I know before I get started?

The best way to directly collaborate with the project contributors is through
GitHub.

* If you want to raise an issue such as a defect, an enhancement request,
  feature request, or a general issue, please open a GitHub issue.
* If you want to contribute to our code by either fixing a problem, enhancing
  some code, or creating a new feature, please open a GitHub pull request
  against the master branch.

Before you start to code, we recommend discussing your plans through a GitHub
issue, especially for more ambitious contributions. This gives other
contributors a chance to point you in the right direction, give you feedback on
your design, and help you find out if someone else is working on the same
thing.

It is your responsibility to test and verify, prior to submitting a pull
request, that your updated code doesn't introduce any bugs. Please write a
clear commit message for each commit. Brief messages are fine for small
changes, but bigger changes warrant a little more detail (at least a few
sentences).

Note that all patches from all contributors get reviewed.

After a pull request is made, other contributors will offer feedback. If the
patch passes review, a maintainer will accept it with a comment.
When a pull request fails review, the author is expected to update the pull
request to address the issue until it passes review and the pull request merges
successfully.

At least one review from a maintainer is required for all patches.
